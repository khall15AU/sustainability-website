Code use:
Primarily HTML and CSS, may try some PHP, JavaScript, and even database access through MySQL later

What pages should be apart of the nav bar?

Ideas:
1. Interactive map with recycling locations on campus
2. "Contact us" form that sends email to club President to inquire about joining club or getting info (PHP or javascript)

Recycle Website
****************************************************************************************************
Plan of Attack
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Research each webpage idea and how it will be done
2) Everybody pick what webpage they want
3) Work on own web page & communicate colors and themes and ask for help if needed
